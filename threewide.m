function wide_vector = threewide( a )% threewide.m - converts an input vector (either row or column%               vector) into a column vector repeated in%               three columns.% Usage:% wide_vector = threewide(original_vector);%% You might find this useful for multiplying a vector of scalars% with a column vector of 3-vectors.%% PACKAGE INFOa = a(:);wide_vector = [ a a a ];return
