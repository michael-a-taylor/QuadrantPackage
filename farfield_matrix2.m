function [A_p,B_q] = farfield_matrix2(Nmax,theta,phi)
% farfield_matrix2.m
% Finds matrices which return the far field from VSWF expansion coefficients
%
% usage
% [A_p,B_q] = farfield_matrix(n,m,theta,phi)
%
% then, the electric field is given by
% E=reshape(A_p*(a+2*p2)+B_q*(b+2*q2),length(theta(:)),3);
%
% each row of E is the field (in spherical coordinates) in the
% (theta,phi) direction (assuming a distance scaling factor of kr)
%
% This is an improved version of farfield_matrix.m, which now operates much
% faster and with improved numerical precision. Also, it skips radial field
% components (which are always zero) so it is less memory intensive.
