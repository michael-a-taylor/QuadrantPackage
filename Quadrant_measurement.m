% First, define the particle properties:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Specify refractive indices of the medim and particle
n_medium = 1.33; % Water
% n_medium = 1.36; % Acetone

n_particle = 1.46; %Silica
% n_particle = 1.58;% Polystyrene
% n_particle = 2.285;% Barium Titanate


% Particle size
radius = 5e-7;%(3.7/2)*1e-6; % In units of m

% Next define the measurement setup:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The vacuum wavelength in m
wavelength=1064e-9;

% Objective NA; this defines the trapping beam width. Note, this assumes an
% aberration free objective.
NA=1.23;

% Effective condenser NA
NA_condenser=1.23;

% Polarisation. [ 1 0 ] is plane-polarised along the x-axis, [ 0 1 ] is
% y-polarised, and [ 1 -i ] and [ 1 i ] are circularly polarised.
polarisation = [0 1 ];

% Define the spatial mode of the incident light, in the Laguerre-Gauss
% basis. A Gaussian profile is [0, 0].
lg_mode=[0 0]; 

% To normalize the shot-noise limit, define measured power in W
Power=10e-3; 


% What do we want to calculate:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Which axis do we measure along: x=1, y=2, z=3
axis=1;

% Is the particle axially centered at the stable trap point (=1) or the beam focus (=0)?
Trap=0;


% Define the particle displacements for which we calculate the signal, in
% units of the medium wavelength
dx = linspace(-2,2,81); 

% All needed parameters are now defined.  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% [ x y z ] coordinates.

% Specify the beam width. 
beam_angle = asin(NA/n_medium)*180/pi;
w0 = lg_mode_w0( lg_mode, beam_angle );

% Wavenumber
k = 2*pi*n_medium/wavelength;

% To what order do we expand the fields?
Nmax = ka2nmax(k*radius);
